		<h4>Case Study 01</h3>
		<h1>Therapy Pet Pals of Texas</h1>
		<h3 class="subtitle">Website re-building and re-branding of through UX/UI methodologies</h2>
		
		<h5>As a dog lover with an incredibly sweet ESA, I first came across Therapy Pet Pals to volunteer my dog. As I realized that my 19 hour semester (at the time) wouldn't necessarily allow me to volunteer as much as I wanted to, I decided to find another way to help!
		</h5>

		<h2>About the Organization</h2>
		<p>Therapy Pet Pals of Texas is a non-profit, 501(C)(3) volunteer organization based in Austin, TX that provides pet therapy for institutionalized individuals in healthcare facilities who often lack companionship and encouragement.</p>

		<h2>The Problem</h2>
		<p>The website’s design has not been touched since the 90s, so there is an immense need for a website redesign / rebranding. The clunky architecture prevents users from easily learning more about the history of the organization, how to volunteer, or how to donate.</p>

		<h2>Opportunities for improvement</h2>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Wide optimal line lengths throughout the site resulting in blocks of text that impede readability</li>
			<li>Too many navigational buttons, leading to user confusion</li>
			<li>Lack of responsive mobile and tablet versions of the site</li>
			<li>Lack of visual separators on pages with more than two sections, confusing users with multiple versions of information (example: training dates for Houston vs. Austin)</li>
			<li>Harsh colors that clash throughout the site</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Design goal</h2>
		<p>My goal was to make the website more inviting and accessible, particularly for older visitors. I achieved this by implementing a warm, minimalistic design and simplifying navigation by making important links more prominent and intuitive.</p>

		<h2>Initial Questions</h2>

		<p><u>Who is the target audience?</u></p>
		<ul>
			<li>People who want to volunteer</li>
			<li>Organizations who are looking for TPPT’s services</li>
			<li>A wide spectrum of people aged 20-65 years old</li>
		</ul>

		<p><u>What are the main things that the audience looks for when they get to the site?</u></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Volunteer and contact information, as well as information on how to donate</li>
		</ul>

		<p><u>What are the Organizations goals?</u></p>
		<ul>
			<li>To recruit and train as many volunteers they can in order to spread the philanthropy of pet therapy</li>
		</ul>
